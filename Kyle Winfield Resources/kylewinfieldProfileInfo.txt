My name is Kyle Winfield, student number s3541867.
I'm a 23 year old student studying IT, I have worked various jobs from casual hospitality to basic IT helpdesk support.
I've been playing competitive video games for the last few years and spend most of my free time doing so. It is my main hobby and interest.
My interest in it has developed from a young age, where I spent my time using the computer and playing video games. In school, I took an interest in computer networking and was quite passionate about it. Later on in my life, I worked for the DHHS doing level 1 IT help desk support.
