    <h1> The Kyles</h1>
      <h2> Kyle Winfield </h2>
        <p>My name is Kyle Winfield, student number s3541867.
        I'm a 23 year old student studying IT, I have worked various jobs from casual hospitality to basic IT helpdesk support.
        I've been playing competitive video games for the last few years and spend most of my free time doing so. It is my main hobby and interest.
        My interest in it has developed from a young age, where I spent my time using the computer and playing video games. In school, I took an interest in computer networking and was quite passionate about it. Later on in my life, I worked for the DHHS doing level 1 IT help desk support.

      <h2> Kyle BroadHurst </h2>
      <p> My name is Kyle Broadhurst, my student id is s3851557 and I'm a 23 year old born in Sydney and raised in Bendigo, currently living in Geelong I spend most of my days working at the local Kebab shop and going out with friends. To this day my highest education has been Year 12, I did briefly partake in an accounting course but I dropped it because it conflicted with my job. My dream is to play Dota 2 professionally, I have flown interstate to compete in events and it has been lots of fun. I have no official experience in IT besides living in the modern age but I am very interested in learning how our technology runs i.e coding.

      <h2>Personality Comparison</h2>
      <p>
      We found our team to score very high on the openness aspect, so we knew it would be a good idea to lay out the assignment early on and decide who does what, we also worked together on discord to keep communication lines open .

      <p>
      Both our dream jobs require a great understanding of coding, with multiple years of prior experience. Both jobs need you to be a self motivated worker and are very rewarding for being so. The main difference between the jobs is the Singaporean one is more hardware based while the other one is entirely focused of software. It would be safe to safe both career plans follow a similar  path in the IT industry, just a difference in the outputs.
